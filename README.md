# Project Pegasus a 2021 Space Apps Project
---
Project Pegasus is a free-to-play two-dimensional RPG-survival game that simulates the adventures of space travel astronauts face in exploring the cosmos. Players will manage a team of up to four astronauts by giving out tasks while taking care of each astronautâ€™s health and well-being. The user will also be responsible for mitigating ship compartment malfunctions, home-sickness, microgravity-induced bone and muscle loss, and many more. A mission to the moon could take up to 10 minutes of gameplay, while a trip to Mars, Io, and other destinations could take up to 30 minutes from the user. All of this is implemented using Unity version 2021.1.22f1 using the C# programming language. The pixel artwork conveys a simple but nostalgic atmosphere that players will surely enjoy.
